This little side-project was my first exploration into Android app development. I used AndroidStudio to develop a simple mobile app to solve an inputted sudoku board.
My sudoku solving algorithm relies on backtracking to solve even the most difficult sudoku boards within milliseconds. I hope to eventually expand this project to include
board scanning functionality so that you can take a picture of your sudoku board rather than manually inputting each given cell. See demo below:
